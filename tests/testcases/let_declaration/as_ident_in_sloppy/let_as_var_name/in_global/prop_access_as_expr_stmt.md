## Input

`````js
let.foo;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
      expression: {
        type: 'MemberExpression',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:7},source:''},
        computed: false,
        optional: false,
        object: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:3},source:''},
          name: 'let'
        },
        property: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:4},end:{line:1,column:7},source:''},
          name: 'foo'
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (5x):
       ID_let PUNC_DOT IDENT PUNC_SEMI
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Let declaration missing binding names and `let` cannot be a regular var or label name in strict mode

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ let.foo;
   ║ ^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as strict mode._

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [sloppy][annexb:no]:

````js
(let).foo;
````

Produces same AST
