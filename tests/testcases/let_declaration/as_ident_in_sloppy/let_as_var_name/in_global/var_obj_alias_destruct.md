## Input

`````js
var {foo: let} = x;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:19},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'VariableDeclaration',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:19},source:''},
      kind: 'var',
      declarations: [
        {
          type: 'VariableDeclarator',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:4},end:{line:1,column:18},source:''},
          id: {
            type: 'ObjectPattern',
            loc:{start:{line:1,column:4},end:{line:1,column:14},source:''},
            properties: [
              {
                type: 'Property',
                loc:{start:{line:1,column:5},end:{line:1,column:13},source:''},
                key: {
                  type: 'Identifier',
                  loc:{start:{line:1,column:5},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
                  name: 'foo'
                },
                kind: 'init',
                method: false,
                computed: false,
                value: {
                  type: 'Identifier',
                  loc:{start:{line:1,column:10},end:{line:1,column:13},source:''},
                  name: 'let'
                },
                shorthand: false
              }
            ]
          },
          init: {
            type: 'Identifier',
            loc:{start:{line:1,column:17},end:{line:1,column:18},source:''},
            name: 'x'
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

tokens (10x):
       ID_var PUNC_CURLY_OPEN IDENT PUNC_COLON ID_let PUNC_CURLY_CLOSE
       PUNC_EQ IDENT PUNC_SEMI
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Can not use `let` as variable name in strict mode

start@1:0, error@1:10
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ var {foo: let} = x;
   ║           ^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as strict mode._

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [sloppy][annexb:no]:

````js
var {foo:let} = x;
````

Produces same AST
