## Input

`````js
for (let();;);
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:14},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ForStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:14},source:''},
      init: {
        type: 'CallExpression',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:5},end:{line:1,column:10},source:''},
        callee: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:5},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
          name: 'let'
        },
        arguments: []
      },
      test: null,
      update: null,
      body: {
        type: 'EmptyStatement',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:13},end:{line:1,column:14},source:''}
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (10x):
       ID_for PUNC_PAREN_OPEN ID_let PUNC_PAREN_OPEN PUNC_PAREN_CLOSE
       PUNC_SEMI PUNC_SEMI PUNC_PAREN_CLOSE PUNC_SEMI
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Let binding missing binding names in strict mode

for (let();;);
     ^^^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [sloppy]:

````js
for (((let)());;) ;
````

Produces same AST
