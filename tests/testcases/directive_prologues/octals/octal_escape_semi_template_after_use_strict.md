> Octal escapes in templates are always illegal so this special strict mode edge case does not even apply

## FAIL

## Input

`````js
function f() {
  "use strict";
  ` \8 `
}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Template contained an illegal escape, illegal in a statement

start@1:0, error@3:2
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ function f() {
 2 ║   "use strict";
 3 ║   ` \8 `
   ║   ^------- error
 4 ║ }
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
