These cases are automatically extrapolated and written to their own file.
Each case is applied to each test by simply replacing `#` with the actual case.

## Input

### Cases

> `````js
> ({a:b,...obj}) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> ({...obj} = {}) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> ({...(a,b),c})
> `````

> `````js
> ({...a,b,c})
> `````

> `````js
> ({...(obj)}) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> ({...(a,b)}) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> ({...{a,b}}) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> ({...[a,b]}) => {}
> `````

### Templates

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Private identifier expected after #

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ #
   ║ ^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
