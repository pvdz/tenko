# Tenko parser test cases

> :: group or arrow : arrow
>
> ::> as lhs

The arrow is not a normal expression which is a unique position in the language.

An arrow can not be the left side of a binary op and ASI rules are a little trickier to implement properly.

## Input

One test file is generated for each combination of input case and input template. The `#` in the template is replaced with the input case.

### Cases

> `````js
> x => {}
> `````

> `````js
> async => {}
> `````

> `````js
> (x => {})
> `````

> `````js
> (async => {})
> `````

> `````js
> (x) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> () => {}
> `````

> `````js
> (x, y) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> async x => {}
> `````

> `````js
> async async => {}
> `````

> `````js
> async (x) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> async () => {}
> `````

> `````js
> async (x, y) => {}
> `````

> `````js
> x => ok
> `````

> `````js
> async => ok
> `````

> `````js
> (x) => ok
> `````

> `````js
> () => ok
> `````

> `````js
> (x, y) => ok
> `````

> `````js
> async x => ok
> `````

> `````js
> async async => ok
> `````

> `````js
> async (x) => ok
> `````

> `````js
> async () => ok
> `````

> `````js
> async (x, y) => ok
> `````

### Templates

#### rhs add

`````js
x + #
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Private identifier expected after #

start@1:0, error@1:4
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ x + #
   ║     ^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
