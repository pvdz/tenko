## Input

`````js
await: { async function f(){ break await; } }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  The label (`await`) for this `break` was not defined in the current label set, which is illegal

start@1:0, error@1:35
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ await: { async function f(){ break await; } }
   ║                                    ^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`await`) as a variable name because: Await is illegal as var name with module goal

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ await: { async function f(){ break await; } }
   ║ ^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````


### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
