## Input

`````js
import {a} from "c"; import {b as a} from "c"
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  The `import` keyword can only be used with the module goal

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ import {a} from "c"; import {b as a} from "c"
   ║ ^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Attempted to create a lexical binding for `a` but another binding already existed on the same level

start@1:0, error@1:34
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ import {a} from "c"; import {b as a} from "c"
   ║                                   ^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````


### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
