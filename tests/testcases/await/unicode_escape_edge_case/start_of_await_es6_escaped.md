## Input

`````js
async () => { var \u{61}wait; }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`\u{61}wait`) as a variable name because: Await not allowed here

start@1:0, error@1:18
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ async () => { var \u{61}wait; }
   ║                   ^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (`\u{61}wait`) as a variable name because: Await is illegal as var name with module goal

start@1:0, error@1:18
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ async () => { var \u{61}wait; }
   ║                   ^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````


### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
