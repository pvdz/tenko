## Input

`````js
{
  var f = 123;
  oops: function f(){}
}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  A "labelled function declaration" is only allowed in sloppy web compat mode

{
  var f = 123;
  oops: function f(){}
        ^^^^^^^^------- error

}
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Attempted to create a lexical binding for `f` but another binding already existed on the same level

{
  var f = 123;
  oops: function f(){}
                 ^------- error

}
`````
