> :: statements and declarations : cannot nest a declaration inside a non-block statement : function : async

> ::> else

## Input


`````js
if (x); else async function f() {}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  An async function declaration in web compat mode is still not allowed as `if-else` child, only plain func decls are allowed there

start@1:0, error@1:13
╔══╦═════════════════
 1 ║ if (x); else async function f() {}
   ║              ^^^^^------- error
╚══╩═════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
