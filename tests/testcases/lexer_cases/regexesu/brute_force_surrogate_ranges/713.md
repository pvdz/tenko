## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/TLT-TT[\uDCA9\uD83D\uDCA9-\uDCA9\uDCA9]/u
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: A double unicode quad escape that represents a surrogate pair in char class or group name is only valid with u-flag; Encountered incorrect range (left>right) which is illegal with u-flag; Regex body had an escape or char class range that is invalid with a u-flag, but it did have a u-flag

/TLT-TT[\uDCA9\uD83D\uDCA9-\uDCA9\uDCA9]/u
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
