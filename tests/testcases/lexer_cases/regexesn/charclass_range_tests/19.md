## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/[@{x1f4a9}@-\uD83D@{xfffd}@]/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Encountered incorrect range (left>right, 128169 > 55357, 0x1f4a9 > 0xd83d) which is illegal with u-flag or v-flag; Encountered incorrect range (left>right, 56489 > 55357, 0xdca9 > 0xd83d) when parsing as if without u-flag or v-flag

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /[@{x1f4a9}@-\uD83D@{xfffd}@]/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
