## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/(?<@{x2f9df}@>foo)met\k<@{xfffd}@>/u
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: The start of an group name had a surrogate pair and is therefor only valid with u-flag; Wanted to parse an unescaped group name specifier but it had a bad start: [`@{xfffd}@`, 65533]

/(?<@{x2f9df}@>foo)met\k<@{xfffd}@>/u
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: The start of an group name had a surrogate pair and is therefor only valid with u-flag; Found at least one invalid group name but also at least one valid group name, so this activates +N and triggers this error

/(?<@{x2f9df}@>foo)met\k<@{xfffd}@>/u
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
`````
