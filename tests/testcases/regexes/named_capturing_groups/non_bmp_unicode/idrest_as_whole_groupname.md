> This checks whether `\u{1D7D0}` / `\uD835\uDFD0` is accepted as the start of a valid group name start
>
> Note that this is an ID_REST char, that is not an ID_START char, so it should fail regardless.

> I think that because RegExpIdentifierName is syntactically not parse-able (because the first character is a number), the whole thing is never "again" parsed as a groupname in webcompat mode. In other words, it never traverses the +N route.
>
> Since it won't trigger +N, it won't parse a group in webcompat, so it passes as an extended atom.

## Input

`````js
/(?<@{x1d7d0}@>foo)/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Wanted to parse an unescaped group name specifier but it had a bad start: [`@{xd835}@`, 55349]

/(?<@{x1d7d0}@>foo)/
^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [web]:

````js
/(?<@{x1d7d0}@>foo)/;
````

Produces same AST
