## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/(?<\u{2F9DF}>foo)met\k<\ud87e\udddf>/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Found a unicode ruby escape which is only valid with u-flag or v-flag; A double unicode quad escape that represents a surrogate pair in char class or group name is only valid with u-flag or v-flag; Found a codepoint in a `\k` escape group name that requires the u-flag or v-flag to be considered valid; Regex contained syntax that is only valid with the u-flag or v-flag but neither was present

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /(?<\u{2F9DF}>foo)met\k<\ud87e\udddf>/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode with annexB._
