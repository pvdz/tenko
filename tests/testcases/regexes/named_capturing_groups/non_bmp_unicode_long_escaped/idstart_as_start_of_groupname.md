## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/(?<\u{2F9DF}rest>foo)/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: The es6 long unicode escape is only valid with u-flag; Encountered extended unicode escape (`\u{}`) or surrogate pair unicode quads (`\uxxxx\uxxxx`) which is only valid with u-flag; Regex body had an escape that is only valid with an u-flag, but it had no u-flag

/(?<\u{2F9DF}rest>foo)/
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
