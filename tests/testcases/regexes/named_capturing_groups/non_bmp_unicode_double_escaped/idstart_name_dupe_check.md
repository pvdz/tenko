## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/(?<\ud87e\udddf>foo)met\k<\ud87e\udddf>/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: A double unicode quad escape that represents a surrogate pair in char class or group name is only valid with u-flag; Found a quad that was a surrogate pair which created a valid identifier character and that will only work with u-flag; Regex body had an escape that is only valid with an u-flag, but it had no u-flag

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /(?<\ud87e\udddf>foo)met\k<\ud87e\udddf>/
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
